# ðŸ“Š X (Prev. Twitter) Sentiment Patterns Analysis

## Overview  
This project involves performing sentiment pattern analysis on a real-world Twitter dataset to explore public sentiment distribution for various brands and topics. The goal is to visualize how users react to different entities on social media and identify sentiment trends using exploratory data analysis.

---

## Dataset  
The dataset contains social media posts from Twitter, labeled by:
- **Tweet ID**
- **Entity** (Brand/Topic)
- **Sentiment** (Positive, Negative, Neutral, Irrelevant)
- **Tweet Content**

The data was preprocessed for analysis and visualized to uncover sentiment distributions and entity-specific public reactions.

## Project Tasks  
- Data Cleaning: Removing duplicates, checking for nulls, and preparing the dataset.  
- Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualizing sentiment and entity distributions using bar plots and pie charts.  
- Entity-wise Sentiment Analysis: Identifying which brands/topics received the most positive, negative, neutral, and irrelevant responses.
